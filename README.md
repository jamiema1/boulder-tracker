# boulder-tracker

This is a full stack web development application that keeps track of the bouldering problems that I have either completed or are still working on. 

In the backend, I use the Express.js framework along with MySQL to manage the databases. 

In the frontend, I use React to build the UI.

Available features:
- Add a new boulder problem to the database
